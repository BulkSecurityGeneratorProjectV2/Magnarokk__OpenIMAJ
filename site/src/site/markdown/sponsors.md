OpenIMAJ History and Sponsors
=============================

OpenIMAJ has a long history, starting well before its public release; Parts of the original codebase come from projects funded by the European Union's [6th Framework Programme](http://cordis.europa.eu/fp6/), the [Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council](http://www.epsrc.ac.uk), the [Arts and Humanities Research Council](http://www.ahrc.ac.uk), [http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/](Ordnance Survey) and the [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk).

Current development of the OpenIMAJ and ImageTerrier software is primarily funded by the European Union [Seventh Framework Programme](http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/home_en.html) under 
the [ARCOMEM](http://www.arcomem.eu) project (grant agreement 270239). The initial public releases were also funded by the European Union [Seventh Framework Programme](http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/home_en.html) under the [LivingKnowledge](http://www.livingknowledge-project.eu/) (grant agreement 231126) together with the [LiveMemories](http://livememories.org/) project, graciously funded by the [Autonomous Province of Trento](http://www.provincia.tn.it).
