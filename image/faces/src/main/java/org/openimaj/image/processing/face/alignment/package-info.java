/**
 * The alignment package contains implementations of face 
 * aligners. Aligners take a detected face and skew it
 * to a canonical alignment in order to improve recognition
 * rates when the face exhibits any form of transformation
 * from the norm.
 * <p>
 * OpenIMAJ contains a number of aligners with varying degrees
 * of power and complexity. The {@link org.openimaj.image.processing.face.alignment.FaceAligner}
 * interface defines a standard interface for all aligners.
